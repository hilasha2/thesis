# Thesis
Supplementary material for my thesis: Identifying Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) signals using gut metagenomics (MGX) and metatranscriptomics (MTX).

The thesis' goal was to capture IBD signals of shotgun MGX and MTX sequences of IBD patients using bioBakery metaâ€™omic tools. In addition, the goal was to develop and test new analytic approaches for MGX involving testing whether a transformation of relative abundance tables to a different representation mitigates the over-representation of features originating from abundant species 

This repository includes some results from my thesis.
