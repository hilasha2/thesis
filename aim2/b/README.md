    Run first filtering_genefamilies.ipynb with hmp2_mtg_genefamilies_wo_bad_samples.tsv as input to get output hmp2_mgx_genefamilies_filtered_10_perc_detection.tsv.
    Then run hmp2_mgx_genefamilies_filtered_10_perc_detection.tsv for figures 10 and 11 or 
    hmp2_mgx_genefamilies_stratified_significant_8359_features_filtered_10_perc_detection.tsv for figure 12.
