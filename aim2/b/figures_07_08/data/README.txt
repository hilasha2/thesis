Two samples were mistakenly not downloaded from IBDMDB, hence,  hmp2_mgx_metaphlan3_taxonomic_profiles.tsv misses two samples.

In hmp2_metadata_2018-08-20.csv
reads_filtered is the reads filtered after the kneaddata ran from biobakery3 (only 1 strand!)
reads_filtered_old might be the data previously filtered by the huttenhower team, but it fits the number of the raw reads (se) of the samples in my biobakery3 run
