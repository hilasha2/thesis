Aim 2.c. – Process MTX results in relation to the MGX. 

Figure 13: Scatter plots of number of features per sample as a function of number
of reads filtered by KneaData, for HMP2’s MT samples from the 1 st 3 weeks of the
experiment.

Figure 14: Heatmap of HMP2’s RNA/DNA pathways abundance table with core pathways (80% detection of both RNA and DNA abundance in the samples) and variable pathways (less than 80% RNA/DNA detection).
Figure 15: Zoom-in view of pathways of interest from the core-variable heatmap
